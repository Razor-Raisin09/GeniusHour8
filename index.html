   <div class="fixun"><p>Coding is a significant aspect of our everyday lives, and is used to manufacture apps for education, games, website, social media, and is used in workplaces to develop solutions. Coding education in schools are increasing in order to develop skills required for the future. Coding is significant in many aspects of our dail lives, and is important to learn of it as well. In this article, I will be explaining what code is, how to use it, what you can produce, along with starting to code!</p></div>

          <h4>What is code?</h4>
          <p>Code is defined as a set of instructions or commands written in a certain programming language that when executed, perform a specific action, - that is, when instructions are written in a specific procedure to result in a specific outcome. A programming language is a language that enables communication between humans and computers; we write some code that is turned into information in computer language, and produces the desired result. We write code according to the principles of the programming language, and when executed, we receive the final result. There are many different programming languages you can use depending on your end goal, though there are specific languages that are more desirable to use in certain situations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class='what'>
          <h4>What can we do with code?</h4>
          <p>
            There are various things that one is capable of doing with coding, such as designing websites, programming robots, machine learning and AI, developing games, animation, and the like! Coding is also capable of being utilized to develop softwares, and automating your own system as well. 
            </p>
        </div>

          <h4>Which Programming language should I choose?</h4>
          <p>Now that you know what you can do with code, what programming language should you learn? That really depends on your end goal and what you want to achieve. There are over 600 programming languages that you can choose from, however, I’ll discuss a few popular and important options in today’s society in sections. It is also important to choose a programming language that you are both interested in, and is useful in today’s society. HTML, CSS and javascript are mainly used for web development (making websites), whilst Python, C++, C#, are better used for developing games and softwares that work fast (especially C++), and SQL is used for analyzing data.</p>
<br></br>
           <p><strong>{HTML and CSS}</strong></p> <br>
            <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and is utilized to develop and strcuture a web page. HTML consists of elements or code pieces that instruct the browser how to display the content and information. It has its own context and procedure to write code. CSS, on the other hand stands for cascading style sheets, and is used to describe how HTML elements are displayed on the screen; in other words, it designs the webpage. If you're interested in learning HTML, then CSS is a must to further your plans and projects! In addition to that, javascript would be an immensely useful language as well. </p>

<br>
            <p><strong>Javascript</strong><br></p>
<p>Javascript is another great language to use when learning how to code. It is used to develop interactive, and user-friendly websites, and is useful in animation and developin effects in a website to allow the audience to be engaged. It is one of the core languages used in web development and it is greatly utilized and required for most jobs. </p>
<br><br>
            <p><strong>C++ and C#</strong><br></p>
<p>C++ is defined as a powerful, all-purpose programming language that is used for designing and building applications and games with fast performance. C++ is used in managaing large websites, browsers like google chorme, desktop apps, video games, robotics, game development and the like! It is exteremly useful if your are aiming to develop a large project or video game. C# is one of the most popular languages that operates in WIndows, Linux, iOS, and Android. C# is the most preferred website used by game developers and mobile app creators. It is easier that C++ due to the eaier code syntax (writing format).</p> 
            <br><br>
<p><strong>Python</strong><br></p> 
<p>Python is a language commonly used in data science, as well as machine learning, and web development as well. Python's context is relatively easy to learn, and therefore is one of the most popular choices for beginners. Python is slower than C#, though is able to produce effective results.</p>
<br><br>

<p><strong>SQL</strong><br></p>
<p>"Sequel" is a data-based programming language, and it is used to store information and for scientific research. </p>
<br><br>
<p><strong>Java</strong><br></p>
<p>Java is a more "back-end" development language, meaning that is deals with information behind the website such as processing information delivered by audeince and the like. It also involes big data devolpment and is used for desktop computing, and numerical calculations as well. </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Another thing to keep in mind, is that here is no “wrong” programming language to choose from, though it is more efficient to choose one with an easy context in order to expand your knowledge. </p>

          <h5><strong>Where do I go from here?</strong></h5>
          <p>
            Now that you’ve selected a main programming language that you are interested in and that seems suitable for you, it is important to manage your time effectively and work towards that end goal. 
            <br>
            I would recommend using resources such as codecademy, freecodecamp.org, and alternate free resources that are quite explanatory and effective. You can also find alternate resources and watch youtube videos and crash courses in order to obtain an introduction to the language you want to learn about. It may seem difficult at first, however, the end result is definitely worth the hard work! In conclusion, coding is a significant skill to have, and one that is quite amusing as well!
